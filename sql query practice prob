WHERE status = 'available';                            /    To get the title that is available in the books table so we need to join them.

SELECT b.Title, b.Genre, bc.ShelfLocation
FROM books b                                        \

ON m.memberid = l.loanid;                             /     after noticing that we need to join three tables 

SELECT m.FirstName, m.LastName, b.title, l.LoanDate, l.DueDate
FROM members m
INNER JOIN loans l
ON m.memberid = l.MemberID
INNER JOIN bookcopies bc                                            \
ON l.CopyID = bc.CopyID               ------------------------------=> multiple tables joined.
INNER JOIN books b                                                  /
ON bc.bookid = b.BookID
WHERE bc.Status = 'Borrowed';
